Notes
-----
This is a very quick-and-dirty implementation of a bit-banged I2C interface.
It has been tested with a SSD1306 display (Write-only) and a BMP085 pressure 
sensor (read/write) on the same bus.

By default this library uses A4/A5, similar to old shields which had their
I2C interface on these pins.  This doesn't mean you should try using old
shields with this library because the Zero is *NOT* 5v compatible.
